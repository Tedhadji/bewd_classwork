	<p style='font-size:16px'>Merry month of may, sunny skies of blue,
		clouds have rolled away and the sun peeps thru,
		May express happiness, joy you may define in a thousand ways,
		but a case like mine needs a 
		to reveal how I feel.</p>

		<p>I've got the world on a string, sittin' on a rainbow,
		Got the string around my finger,,
		What a world, what a life, I'm in love!
		I've got a song that I sing,</p>
		<p>
		I can make the rain go, anytime I move my finger,
		Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love,
		Life is a beautiful thing, as long as I hold the string,
		I'd be a silly so and so, if I should ever let go,
		</p>
