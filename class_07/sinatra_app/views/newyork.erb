		Start spreading the news
		I am leaving today
		I want to be a part of it
		New York, New York</p>

		<p>These vagabond shoes
		Are longing to stray
		Right through the very heart of it
		New York, New York</p>

		<p>I want to wake up in a city
		That doesn't sleep
		And find I'm king of the hill
		Top of the heap</p>

		<p>These little town blues
		Are melting away
		I'll make a brand new start of it
		In old New York</p>

		<p>If I can make it there
		I'll make it anywhere
		It's up to you
		New York, New York</p>

		<p>New York, New York
		I want to wake up in a city
		That never sleeps
		And find I'm a number one
		Top of the list
		King of the hill
		A number one</p>

		<p>These little town blues
		All melting away
		I am gonna make a brand new start of it
		In old New York</p>

		<p>And if I can make it there
		I'm gonna make it anywhere
		It's up to you
		New York, New York, New York</p>
